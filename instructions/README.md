# my-arch instructions
This repo is my guide for myself on how to install Arch Linux. You probably
can find some useful information here, however I created this subrepo with
one purpose only: remind myself all my configurations when reinstalling Arch.
Because of that there're lots of my own custom preferences, which may not suit
you and your machine.
