# my-arch

~~I use Arch btw~~ My main operating system is Arch Linux. It is highly
customizable, which is the reason why I have this repository. Here I store
most of my work related to it, wether it be dotfiles or notes on installation.

Repository structure:
```
/dotfiles     -- custom scripts and configuration files 
/instructions -- personal installation guide
```
