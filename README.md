# Arch-migration
This repo is a collection of writeups and configuration files. This exists for three main reasons:
* With writeups it's easier for me to remember all the things I've learned and all the steps I've taken to make something work
* I can just throw in here all my config files so I won't need to bother with transfering them somehow else
* It's a way for me to track my progress, stuff I've already learned and things I feel like I need to learn before taking any steps in reinstalling my main OS

## Why Arch?
* I want to be able to fully customize my system
* I want to completely understand how everything on my machine works and control it
* I want my system to not be filled with lots of bloatware, that comes with Windows and many other Linux distros
* I want to support idea of free software
* I want to be able to say proudly: "I use Arch btw"
