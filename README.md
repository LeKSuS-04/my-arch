# Arch-migration
This repo is my personal guide to installing Arch Linux. I keep it to make it
easier for future me to reinstall everything from scratch if I'd ever need to.
If you're installing Arch yourself, you probably could find some useful
information there. Note however, although I am trying to be general in these
write-ups, since Arch Linux is VERY customizable Linux distribution, the fact
that this repo contains my personal preferences affects the final result. There
always are different ways to do something, which might suit you and your
machine better.
